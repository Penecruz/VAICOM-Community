Adds the Iraq north to ATC Recipients, adds Afghanistan east to ATC recipients, fixes errors in origional DCS swap files this had the effect of corrupting the radiocommandsdialog.lua and common.lua on second run of DCS. Also I changed some appended files to base line errors prior to bug hunting. Make sure you update you keywords to pick up the new recipients, happy testing!"
